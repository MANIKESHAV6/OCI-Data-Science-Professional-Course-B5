# 🏆 My Journey through the OCI Data Science Professional Course  

I recently wrapped up the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science Professional** course under the **Oracle Race to Certification** program 🎓.  
This experience gave me a complete walkthrough of the **end-to-end ML workflow on OCI** — from setting up projects and preparing datasets, to building, deploying, and maintaining production-ready models.

## 📖 Course Highlights  

Some of the key areas I explored in this course:  
- 🔧 Setting up and managing **workspaces, projects, and users** on OCI Data Science  
- 🧠 Training and deploying **machine learning models** at scale  
- ⚙️ Leveraging **MLOps practices** for automation and reproducibility  
- 🔐 Integrating OCI services like **Vault**, **Object Storage**, **Data Flow**, and **Data Labeling**  
- 📊 Implementing **monitoring strategies** to track and improve model performance

## 💡 My Learnings  

### 1️⃣ Working with OCI Data Science  
- Organized work using **workspaces & projects** 🗂️  
- Configured **security, IAM roles, and networking** 🔐  
- Used the **ADS SDK** to streamline data loading and preprocessing  
**Example:** Pulled data from Object Storage directly into a Jupyter notebook with minimal setup.  

---

### 2️⃣ Machine Learning on OCI  
- 🧹 **Prepared data** through cleaning and feature engineering  
- 🤖 **Built models** using XGBoost and scikit-learn libraries  
- ✅ **Validated performance** with metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and recall  
- 🚀 **Deployed APIs** for real-time predictions  
**Example:** Created and deployed a churn prediction model that delivered live results.  

---

### 3️⃣ Automation & MLOps  
- Designed **pipelines** for continuous training when new data arrived  
- Monitored deployed models to detect **accuracy drifts** 📉  
- Maintained **versioned workflows** for reliability and traceability  
**Example:** Automated monitoring jobs that send alerts if a model underperforms.  

---

### 4️⃣ Using OCI Services Together  
- 🔐 Secured secrets and credentials with **OCI Vault**  
- ☁️ Stored datasets and artifacts in **Object Storage**  
- ⚡ Handled large-scale preprocessing with **OCI Data Flow**  
- 🏷️ Built labeled datasets with **Data Labeling Service**  
👉 This helped me design a **robust and enterprise-ready ML pipeline**.  

---

### 5️⃣ Practical Best Practices  
- Followed **cloud security standards** like IAM and encryption  
- Balanced **cost vs. scalability** with flexible compute options  
- Applied ML to **real-world cases** including forecasting, NLP, and churn analytics
